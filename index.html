      <h2 class="trig">Why Swing Trade?</h2>
      <p>
      I was a bank nifty option scalper a few years back. I used to punch min 100+ orders per day. I usually look for per day profits. But due to the excess screen time and the intricacy of the setup, I couldn't able to focus on any other stuffs. Not able to spend time with my parents & friends, my health deteriorated and I literally didn't have a meaningful life. (It was due to my own psychological issue).

So I decided to get out of this trading style and decided to do <span class="tag">Swing Trading</span>... <b>The ideology was to form a trading setup that is absolutely effective and less complex.</b> I experimented a lot and finally discovered a trading setup that <span class="tag">suits my personality.</span>

      <h1 class="trig">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
	  <h2 class="trig">1. "Swing trading with less efforts” How does it work?</h2>
      <p>
     You know, Patience can be a skill in trading too! The most important part of trading isn't really about when you buy or sell. It's about what you do before, during, and after those trades. As a trader, you need to have the skill to wait patiently and do nothing sometimes. You can't control what happens to the price of the stocks you're trading, but you can control how you react. That's where the magic happens. In my class, I'll show you a simple technique that can change the way you trade. You'll learn why it's so important to be patient and disciplined. Instead of chasing every little market change, you'll discover how patiently waiting for a few days after the entry will result in a positive outcome. I am using a simple swing trading setup. No need to look for complicated strategies. Join my class and I'll teach you this simple approach to swing trading. It's so simple for anyone, even if you just know the basics of trading.

	  <h2 class="trig">3. Does my strategy works on all the Scripts/Segments?</h2>
      <p>
My trading strategy works only on a particular script . I Trade in GOLD FUT (You can start with jsut ₹ 600) There is a reason why I am trading on this script all the time with this strategy. I will share that in the session. My intention is to make money from the market, not to trade on different different scripts. So it doesn't matter if you trade on 100 scrips or 1 scrip - all it matters is that are you making money from the market?
<br><br>
GOLD is just like NIFTY, BANKNIFTY. There is no much difference. I will teach you all the required basics along with the method. You can trade GOLD in Zerodha, Upstox, Angel, Dhan, Fyers etc... GOLD comes under MCX(Commodities) in Indian Markets.<br>

	  <h2 class="trig">7. Can office goers, students or homemakers join this course?</h2>
      <p>
     Yes. To make money in the stock market with my setup, you don't need to spend a lot of time analyzing charts or searching for patterns. Instead, you can simply spend a few minutes before entering a trade. If you win, your profit percentage will be large, and if you lose, your loss percentage will be small. Try this technique 10 times and see the results for yourself. Rather than constantly staring at the screen, you can make money simply by being patient.<br>

	I don't stare at my screen all the time in search of patterns, stock selection, scanners etc. I make money by sitting simply. ie; with Patience!
