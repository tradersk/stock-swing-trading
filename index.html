      <h2 class="trig"><u>My Problem & the Soultion</u></h2>
      <p>
 My biggest problem in stock swing trading is not the strategy but the stock selection. 
While platforms like Screener, Chartink, and TradingView are great, I personally find it used only for specific purposes, like Screener for fundamental analysis, Tradingview for charting etc. Although all the above great platforms have a good number of data. And they give lots of data which is really confusing. So many strategies, so many filters, so much confusion. Ultimately, even with all these tools, I am not getting a clear-cut stock for the entry. Manually timing stock trades has been mentally tiring and time-consuming for me.<br><br>
Ex- I know what a triangle pattern is, but how can I identify that pattern at the right time and at the right stock? Scrolling through 100s of stock is not something I want to do every day. And there will be 10s of stocks that can have the triangle pattern on the same day of the analysis( with some filters,scanners etc) . Which stock should be entered among these 10s of stocks? This is my biggest challenge.<br><br> And I started working on the solution along with a team in Mumbai for about 8 months. And the result of the work is what i will share in the session.

</h2>
      <p>
• I will share the complete methodologies that I use for the entry, exit & SL<br>
• How do I get the right stocks at the right time?<br>
• No need to manually go through all the stocks. That is the surprise. <br>

      <p>
      
• <b>The fee is ₹10,000 one-time fees</b><br>
• <b> UPI: sreekrishnansk@upi</b><br>
• Please share the screenshot via telegram/Instagram, and I'll add you to the session group.<br><br>

• The solution for the swing trading stock selection is developed in a partnership agreement with a Team in Mumbai (as you know, I currently stay here). A lot of investment have been made from my side as well as from their side. We have larger plans to reach it to wide traders which are not just limited to the TraderSK community. The price is much higher for those outside our Community.<br><br>

• There will be a separate community only for the existing TraderSK members. New expansions/ideas that we have won't affect our existing member community in any way yet you will get all the benefits… My support will continue as usual… 1-1 DMs, my trade updates, etc.<br><br>

</h2>
      <p>
      
• Community Support<br>
• I take trades with the stocks and I will share the video with a proper explanation of why the stock is the right candidate for the swing trade. the reason for the entry, where my sl is, target..<br>
• This time, I will maintain a new trading account and share my live trade performance.<br>
• Get the Continuous future improvements.<br><br>

Once you learn the core strategy principles, you can even find chart setups and trade on your own without my help. Although I’ll share my personal trades as well<br>

      <h1 class="trig"><u>BACKTESTED RESULT</u>
</h1><br>
	      <h2 class="trig">Stocks are forward-tested, not back-tested. This means all the data below is collected live, not tested on past charts.</h2>
      <p><br>

- Total Stocks Tested: 70<br>
- Capital Used: ₹10 Lakhs (With an allocation of no more than ₹15,000 per trade)<br>
- Testing Period: 1/12/2023 - 15/07/2024<br> <br>

Note: All metrics are based on the highest price achieved in the stock after entry.<br><u>Trading Performance as of 27/07/2024</u><br>
• Combined High ROI After Entry: 1,593%<br>
• Maximum Profit per Stock: 143%<br>
• Maximum Drawdown per Stock: -23%<br>
• Combined Average ROI: 24.6%<br>
• Total Profits from the Stocks with Average ROI: 171%<br>
• Percentage Success: 75.38%<br>
• RRR ( Difference between max profit (143%) & Max Drawdawn(-23%): 1:6 RRR<br>
• Total Profits from the Stocks with Average ROI: 171%<br>
• Probability of Success: 75.4%<br>
• Win Rate: 75.38%<br>
• Number of winning stocks: 53<br>
• Number of losing stocks: 17<br>
• Average Trades per Month: 8<br><br>

I will show you the list of stocks entered and the reason for the entry as well!<br><br>

This is a pure swing trading method backed by effective/time-tested price action technicals. The holding period will be in weeks/months. Sometimes, it will give an excellent move within a few days.. If it’s hitting the SL, then it will be in our RRR favor. As with any swing trading method, Patience is an important skill required.<br><br>

"I usually keep my excitement low, but a new chapter is about to start. I’ve started using this method, and I hope you'll join on board to reap the benefits!"<br>
Thanks<br>
